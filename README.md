The game is played with 2 players - the player and the dealer. Each turn you can choose whether to stand or draw another card.
The goal is to draw one card at a time and add it to the hand, as long as the value of all the cards in the hand does not exceed 21
If the value exceeds 21 - you are eliminated. If both players choose to stand before they are eliminated - the values ​​of the cards in the hand are compared, and the value that is closer to 21 wins. If the values ​​are equal - a draw.
